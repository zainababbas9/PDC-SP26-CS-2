# Chapter # 1

## 1. dir.py

### What I learned: 
I learned basic of if else and list and for loop

### How to execute:
Run in cmd : **Python dir.py** to see how python differentiate between  +ve, -ve and zero and also to see the sum of the lists.

### Use cases: 
Basic data validation and simple mathematical transformations of list-based data sets.

### Requirements for execution: 
A standard Python installation, no external modules or libraries are necessary.

### Advantages: 
Extremely lightweight and fast; it demonstrates the core foundation of almost every functional Python script.

### Disadvantages: 
The logic is static; if you want to check different numbers, you must manually edit the script or use input.

---

## 2. `lists.py`

### What I learned:
I learned the differences between mutable lists, unchangeable tuples, and key-value pairs in dictionaries.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python lists.py** to see how to access and modify items in a list and how to update values in a dictionary.

### Use cases:
Storing collections of data, mapping unique keys to values (like a dictionary), and grouping related items together.

### Requirements for execution:
Standard Python installation; utilizes built-in data structures without needing imports.

### Advantages:
Highly flexible; lists can hold different data types at once, and dictionaries offer extremely fast data retrieval.

### Disadvantages:
Tuples cannot be modified after creation, which can be restrictive if the data needs to change.

---

## 3. `do_something.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to create a reusable helper function that utilizes the `random` module to populate a list with decimal numbers.

### How to execute:
This file is a module; it is executed by being imported into other scripts like `serial_test.py` or `multiprocessing_test.py` using **from do_something import ***.

### Use cases:
Generating large datasets for performance testing, simulations, or any task requiring a high volume of random data.

### Requirements for execution:
The Python `random` module (built-in) and another script to call the function.

### Advantages:
Follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle by keeping specific logic in a single, manageable file.

### Disadvantages:
It does not perform any action when run by itself; it strictly acts as a dependency for other programs.

---

## 4. `flow.py`

### What I learned:
I learned three core control flow tools: `if/elif/else` for logic, `for` loops for lists, and `while` loops for conditional repetition.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python flow.py** to see the results of logical checks and two different ways to calculate numerical sums.

### Use cases:
Automation scripts, data filtering, and creating loops that run until a specific goal or condition is reached.

### Requirements for execution:
Proper indentation of code blocks, which is required for Python to identify the scope of loops and conditions.

### Advantages:
Comprehensive; it covers all the primary ways to control the "flow" or direction of a program's execution.

### Disadvantages:
`while` loops can cause the program to hang in an "infinite loop" if the counter variable is not updated correctly.

---

## 5. `classes.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to create classes, use the `__init__` constructor, and the difference between shared class variables and instance-specific variables.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python classes.py** to see how modifying a class-level variable affects all objects, while instance variables remain unique to each one.

### Use cases:
Building structured applications like student databases, banking systems, or any program that models real-world objects through inheritance.

### Requirements for execution:
A standard Python installation and an understanding of the `self` argument used within class methods.

### Advantages:
Promotes code reusability and organization; inheritance allows a new class to take on the properties of an existing one.

### Disadvantages:
Can become complex and harder to debug as the hierarchy of inherited classes grows deeper.

---

## 6. `file.py`

### What I learned:
I learned the basics of file I/O, specifically how to open, write text to, close, and read back from a `.txt` file.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python file.py** to generate a file named `test.txt` and see its contents printed to the console.

### Use cases:
Saving user logs, storing configuration settings, or exporting reports and data for later use.

### Requirements for execution:
Standard file system write permissions and the built-in `open()` function.

### Advantages:
Provides data persistence, meaning your data is saved on the hard drive even after the program is closed.

### Disadvantages:
Using the `'w'` mode overwrites the file every time the script runs, which can lead to accidental data loss.

---

## 7. `serial_test.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to measure the execution time of a task when it is performed sequentially (one after the other).

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python serial_test.py** to execute the random number task 10 times in a single sequence.

### Use cases:
Baseline performance testing or simple scripts where tasks must be completed in a specific, linear order.

### Requirements for execution:
The `time` module for benchmarking and the `do_something.py` file located in the same folder.

### Advantages:
The logic is straightforward and easy to debug because only one thing happens at a time.

### Disadvantages:
Very slow for heavy workloads as it only uses one CPU core, leaving the rest of the processor's power idle.

---

## 8. `multiprocessing_test.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to use the `multiprocessing` module to run tasks on separate CPU cores for true parallelism.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python multiprocessing_test.py** to see the performance difference when the CPU handles 10 tasks at once on 10 cores.

### Use cases:
CPU-intensive tasks like image processing, heavy data analysis, or complex mathematical simulations.

### Requirements for execution:
The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to safely manage process creation on different operating systems.

### Advantages:
Bypasses the GIL, allowing the program to run significantly faster by using all available CPU power.

### Disadvantages:
Higher memory (RAM) usage because each process creates its own independent memory space.

---

## 9. `multithreading_test.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to use the `threading` module to attempt running multiple tasks simultaneously within the same memory space.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python multithreading_test.py** to see 10 threads start and process data at the same time.

### Use cases:
Tasks involving waiting (I/O bound), such as downloading multiple files, web scraping, or keeping a user interface responsive.

### Requirements for execution:
The `threading` library and the use of `.start()` and `.join()` to manage the thread lifecycle.

### Advantages:
Threads are "lightweight" and share memory, making them efficient for tasks that don't require heavy CPU calculation.

### Disadvantages:
Due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), it does not provide true parallelism for CPU-heavy math tasks.

---

## 10. `thread_and_processes.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to compare the performance of threading and multiprocessing side-by-side within a single script.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python thread_and_processes.py** to see a direct time comparison between the two different concurrency methods.

### Use cases:
Performance benchmarking and determining which execution method is best for a specific type of workload.

### Requirements for execution:
Importing both `threading` and `multiprocessing` modules and sufficient system resources to handle the heavy load.

### Advantages:
Provides a clear, empirical view of how different system architectures (threads vs processes) handle the same data.

### Disadvantages:
The script is resource-heavy because it runs a massive workload twice (once for each method).
