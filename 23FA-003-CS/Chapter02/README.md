# Chapter # 2

---

## 1. `Thread_definition.py`

### What I learned:
I learned the most basic way to define and launch threads by passing a target function and arguments to the `Thread` constructor.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python Thread_definition.py** to see 10 threads call the same function and print their assigned numbers.

### Use cases:
Quick, simple background tasks that don't require complex object-oriented logic or custom data.

### Requirements for execution:
The `threading` module and the `target` and `args` parameters.

### Advantages:
The fastest way to implement threading with very little code; excellent for simple parallelization.

### Disadvantages:
Harder to manage thread-specific state compared to inheriting from the Thread class.

---

## 2. `MyThreadClass.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to create a custom thread by inheriting from the `threading.Thread` class and overriding the `run()` method.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python MyThreadClass.py** to spawn nine custom threads that run and sleep for random durations independently.

### Use cases:
Encapsulating complex thread logic into an object-oriented structure for cleaner, more maintainable code.

### Requirements for execution:
Defining a class that inherits from `Thread` and calling the `__init__` of the parent class.

### Advantages:
Allows you to attach specific data (like `name` and `duration`) directly to the thread object for easier management.

### Disadvantages:
Requires more boilerplate code compared to just passing a simple function to a standard Thread object.

---

## 3. `Thread_determine.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to name threads and identify them during execution using `threading.currentThread().getName()`.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python Thread_determine.py** to see three different functions start and exit, identifying themselves by name.

### Use cases:
Logging and debugging complex multi-threaded apps where you need to know exactly which thread produced a specific error or log.

### Requirements for execution:
The `name` attribute in the `Thread` constructor and the `currentThread()` function.

### Advantages:
Makes terminal output much more readable; you can tell "Function_A" from "Function_B" immediately.

### Disadvantages:
Names are for human readability only; they do not change how the Python interpreter handles the thread logic.

---

## 4. `MyThreadClass_lock.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to use a `threading.Lock` to enforce "Mutual Exclusion," ensuring only one thread can access a code block at a time.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python MyThreadClass_lock.py**; notice that threads now finish one by one in order because they must wait for the lock.

### Use cases:
Protecting shared data (like a bank balance or a shared file) from being modified by two threads at the exact same time.

### Requirements for execution:
A global `threading.Lock()` object and the use of `acquire()` and `release()` around critical code.

### Advantages:
Completely prevents data corruption by ensuring that only one "worker" is in the sensitive area of the code at once.

### Disadvantages:
Significantly slows down the program because it turns parallel execution back into sequential execution while the lock is held.

---

## 5. `MyThreadClass_lock_2.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to minimize the "Critical Section" by acquiring and releasing a lock only for the specific line of code that needs protection, rather than the entire function.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python MyThreadClass_lock_2.py** to see how threads print their start message one-by-one but then sleep simultaneously, making the overall execution faster than a full lock.

### Use cases:
Optimizing performance in multi-threaded apps where only a small part of a task (like updating a counter) needs to be synchronized.

### Requirements for execution:
A `threading.Lock()` object and the strategic placement of `acquire()` and `release()` calls within the `run()` method.

### Advantages:
Increases efficiency by allowing threads to perform non-sensitive work (like `time.sleep`) in parallel while still protecting shared resources.

### Disadvantages:
If the lock is released too early, you risk data corruption if another thread modifies the data while the first thread is still processing it.

---

## 6. `Rlock.py`

### What I learned:
I learned about the "Reentrant Lock" (`RLock`), which allows the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times without causing a deadlock.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python Rlock.py** to see an `adder` and `remover` modify a `Box` object that uses nested locked methods.

### Use cases:
Complex objects where one locked method calls another locked method within the same class.

### Requirements for execution:
Replacing a standard `Lock` with `threading.RLock()` when recursive or nested locking is needed.

### Advantages:
Prevents a thread from "locking itself out" when calling its own synchronized methods.

### Disadvantages:
Slightly more overhead than a regular lock; it should only be used when reentrancy is actually required.

---

## 7. `Semaphore.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to use a `Semaphore` to manage access based on a counter, allowing a specific number of threads to pass.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python Semaphore.py** to see a consumer wait for a producer to "release" a permit before it can display the item.

### Use cases:
Limiting connections to a database, controlling how many users can download a file at once, or managing a pool of resources.

### Requirements for execution:
`threading.Semaphore(value)` where value is the number of concurrent permits allowed.

### Advantages:
Much more flexible than a Lock because it can allow multiple threads (e.g., 3 or 5) instead of just one.

### Disadvantages:
More difficult to debug; if a thread forgets to `release()`, a permit is lost forever, potentially causing a system hang.

---

## 8. `Barrier.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to use a `Barrier` to synchronize multiple threads, ensuring that all threads reach a specific point in execution before any of them can proceed.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python Barrier.py** to see three "runners" reach the barrier at different times and only finish the race once the last one arrives.

### Use cases:
Simulating a race, parallel computing where a phase must finish before the next starts, or multi-player game lobby "ready" checks.

### Requirements for execution:
The `threading.Barrier` object initialized with the exact number of threads that must wait for each other.

### Advantages:
Prevents "race conditions" where one part of a program starts too early; very simple to implement for fixed-party synchronization.

### Disadvantages:
If one thread fails or crashes before reaching the barrier, all other threads will wait indefinitely (deadlock).

---

## 9. `Condition.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to use a `Condition` object to allow threads to wait for specific state changes, effectively managing Producer-Consumer relationships.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python Condition.py** to observe a Producer adding items and a Consumer waiting until items are available before removing them.

### Use cases:
Inventory management systems, task queues, or any scenario where a thread depends on a specific variable value to proceed.

### Requirements for execution:
The `threading.Condition` object and the use of `wait()` and `notify()` methods within a `with` statement.

### Advantages:
More efficient than a basic lock because it allows threads to "sleep" and consume zero CPU power while waiting for a notification.

### Disadvantages:
Can lead to complex logic bugs if `notify()` is called at the wrong time or if `wait()` is not checked within a loop.

---

## 10. `Event.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to use an `Event` to communicate between threads using a simple internal "true/false" flag.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python Event.py** to see a consumer thread stop and wait until a producer "sets" the event signal.

### Use cases:
Starting multiple background services at once, stopping threads gracefully, or signaling that a setup process is complete.

### Requirements for execution:
The `threading.Event` object and the `set()`, `clear()`, and `wait()` methods.

### Advantages:
One of the simplest ways for one thread to signal "GO" or "STOP" to many other threads simultaneously.

### Disadvantages:
It is a "binary" signal; it cannot pass data (like a message) between threads, only the fact that an event occurred.

---

## 11. `Thread_name_and_processes.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to verify that all threads created within a script belong to the same Process ID (PID), confirming that threading happens within a single process.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python Thread_name_and_processes.py** to see different thread names printed alongside the OS process ID they are running under.

### Use cases:
System monitoring and debugging to ensure that your application is not accidentally spawning heavy new processes when you only intended to use light threads.

### Requirements for execution:
The `os` module to fetch the process ID and a custom thread class to print the identification data.

### Advantages:
Provides technical proof of how the operating system handles Python threads versus processes.

### Disadvantages:
Since it focuses on identification rather than logic, this script doesn't perform any actual data processing.

---

## 12. `Threading_with_queue.py`

### What I learned:
I learned how to use a `Queue` for thread-safe communication, allowing Producers to send data to multiple Consumers without manually managing locks.

### How to execute:
Run in cmd: **python Threading_with_queue.py** to watch one Producer add random items to a queue while three Consumers compete to pull and process them.

### Use cases:
Handling background tasks like email sending, processing web requests, or any system where tasks are produced faster than they can be finished.

### Requirements for execution:
The `queue.Queue` object and the use of `put()` for producers and `get()` followed by `task_done()` for consumers.

### Advantages:
Queues are inherently thread-safe; they automatically handle the locking logic for you, making your code much cleaner and less prone to errors.

### Disadvantages:
If consumers are slower than the producer, the queue will grow indefinitely and may eventually consume all available system memory.
